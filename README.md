# Repository Consolidation

Going forward, the .NET team is using [dotnet/source-build-reference-packages](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-reference-packages) to develop the code that was previously maintained in this repository.
Pre-10.0 versions remain available in their respective release branches.
