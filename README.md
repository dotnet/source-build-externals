# .NET Source Build Externals

This repo contains the source for components that resides outside of the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet)
organization required to build .NET from source. Examples include Newtonsoft.Json
and Application Insights for .NET. Git submodules are utilized to reference the
external source. This repo contains the infrastructure to build these external
repos within the .NET source build. See
[dotnet/source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build) for more details on
.NET source build.

## How to Build

This repo utilizes the .NET [Arcade](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade) build
infrastructure. Since this repo is intended solely for source build, it usually
 makes sense to build with the -sb (source build) flag.

``` bash
./build.sh -sb
```

## Adding a New External Component

1. Add the repo as a submodule to `./src`

    ```bash
    git submodule add <remote_url> ./src/<destination_dir>
    git commit -m "<commit_message>"
    ```

1. Define a [project](repo-projects) for the new component. The project
is responsible for building the submodule with the appropriate configuration for
source build. See the [existing projects](repo-projects) for examples.

1. [Build](#how-to-build) locally and resolve any build errors. Source changes
must be applied via [patches](patches). See [below](#patches) for more info on patches.

1. Validate the version of the NuGet packages and binaries produced by the build. See the contents of
`./artifacts/packages/<build_configuration>/NonShipping/Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.source-build-externals.x.y.z-dev.nupkg`.

1. If the original binaries have strong name signatures, validate the source built ones have them as well.

## Updating an External Component to a Newer Version

1. Update the `src/<external_repo_dir>` to the desired sha

    ``` bash
    cd src/<external_repo_dir>
    git fetch
    git checkout <updated_sha>
    cd ..
    git add .
    git commit -m "<commit_message>"
    ```

1. [Build](#how-to-build) locally

    1. Update any [patches](patches) as needed.

    1. Review the [repo's project](repo-projects) to ensure it is appropriate for the new version.
    There are a number of projects that utilize MSBuild properties to specify the version.
    These need to be manually updated with each upgrade.

    1. Resolve build errors. Source changes must be applied via [patches](patches).  See [below](#patches) for more info on patches.

1. Validate the version of the NuGet packages and binaries produced by the build. See the contents of
`./artifacts/packages/<build_configuration>/NonShipping/Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.source-build-externals.x.y.z-dev.nupkg`

1. After the PR is merged to update a component, coordination is often needed in the darc dependency flows. The source-build-external update
may need to flow in at the same time as the cooresponding changes in product repos which take a dependency on the new component version.

## Patches

When creating/updating patches, it is desirable to backport the changes whenever feasible as this reduces
the maintenance burden when [updating a component to a newer version](#updating-an-external-component-to-a-newer-version).
